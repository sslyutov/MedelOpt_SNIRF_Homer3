This file contains the fNIRS montage configuration data in a format intended for direct transfer from MeMoSoft (Seenel Imaging) to AcqKnowledge (Biopac Systems, Inc.), ensuring compatibility of optode layout, channel assignments, and acquisition settings between the two applications.
The data is stored in json format

  pos2D_X_mm Identifies the x-position in 2D for an LED or DET with the corresponding value (such as LED1 or DET1) of the 'medelopt' property.
  pos2D_Y_mm Identifies the y-position in 2D for an LED or DET with the corresponding value (such as LED1 or DET1) of the 'medelopt' property.
  pos3D_X_mm Identifies the x-position in 3D for an LED or DET with the corresponding value (such as LED1 or DET1) of the 'medelopt' property.
  pos3D_Y_mm Identifies the y-position in 3D for an LED or DET with the corresponding value (such as LED1 or DET1) of the 'medelopt' property.
  pos3D_X_mm Identifies the z-position in 3D for an LED or DET with the corresponding value (such as LED1 or DET1) of the 'medelopt' property.
